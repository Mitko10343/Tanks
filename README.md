# Tanks


# Concept:

For our our OOP assignment we had to to creat something that would implement all of our knowledge we
had gained so far from our course.
We began  by coming up with some Ideas which we could use for our project. Some of the ideas we came in were:
-A multiplayer racing game.
-Tank arena game 
-Flight simulater
-A phone app
-Game with games

Most of our ideas  were either a race or like a pvp game and since we really wanted to use the theme of war we 
decided to make a tank game with two game modes. One of the game modes would be a race while the other would 
have a PVP aspect.

# Features:

The Game has a number of features we are proud of , such as:

The Terain: All of the terrain is created by us using  the unity editor. The terrain is unique and some of the 
            parts of the terrain were very time consuming to make. The race terrain has a number of wind zones
			which add a very nice animation to the tress.
			
The Movement: The Movement of the tanks is probably the feature we are most proud of. At first we thought its
			  going to be extremely easy ,but the more indepth we went into writing the script for the movement
			  the harder it got. We face a lot of difficulties with trying to ad real life tank physics to the 
			  tanks ,such as making the turning speed of the tank slower if the tank was moving at a higher speed
			  or trying to get the perfect center of mass so the tank wouldn't flip over easily.

Menus:   The menu is a feature wich wasnt that hard to make as it was time consuming. We tried to make it as
		 professional as possible so it would make a good impression to the user from the moment he started up 
		 the game. We also added a pause menu to the game which would allow the user to restart the game when ever 
		 he felt like or even go  back to the main menu.
		
Split Screens: At first we though we will make the game with AI, but then we changed our mind and we though making
			   the game multiplayer would add more fun to it. To make the game 2 player we decided to make a split
			   screen ingame so two players could play at the same time.
		
AI Bots: As well as the multiplayer aspect of the game we felt if we added an AI to the game it would add to the 
		 enjoyment even more so we added in an extra tank in the Racing mode of the game and with the aid of a 
		 script the tank was soon moving on its  own.
		 
Minimap: When testing our game out with some friends, we got some very important feed back. Most of the people that
		 tried out the race mode couldnt find the path they were meant to take so we came up with the idea of adding
		 a minimap to the game.
