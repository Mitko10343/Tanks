# Tanks


#Concept:

For our our OOP assignment we had to to creat something that would implement all of our knowledge we
had gained so far from our course.
We began  by coming up with some Ideas which we could use for our project. Some of the ideas we came in were:
-A multiplayer racing game.
-Tank arena game 
-Flight simulater
-A phone app
-Game with games

Most of our ideas  were either a race or like a pvp game and since we really wanted to use the theme of war we 
decided to make a tank game with two game modes. One of the game modes would be a race while the other would 
have a PVP aspect.
